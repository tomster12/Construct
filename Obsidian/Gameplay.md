## Overview

The user controls [[Construct|constructs]] through the use of a [[Core|core]], exploring the world with the intent of upgrading and growing through the use of [[Rune|runes]] and different [[Orb|orbs]].

The core can also be changed out, in turn allowing them to use more powerful orbs and runes.

A [[#Forging|forging]] mode is accessible, which allows you to see statistics and swap out your runes, orbs, and your core.
