## Overview

The user controls [[Construct|constructs]] through the use of a [[Core|core]], exploring the world with the intent of upgrading and growing through the use of [[Rune|runes]] and different [[Orb|orbs]].

The core can also be changed out, in turn allowing them to use more powerful orbs and runes.

A [[#Forging|forging]] mode is accessible, which allows you to see statistics and swap out your runes, orbs, and your core.

## Forging

Forging mode allows the user to edit and access the current [[Construct|construct]] in an interactive 3D interface, through laying out intuitively the [[Orb|orbs]], [[Rune|runes]], and your [[Core|core]].

This screen will also shows succint descriptions of the statistics of each individual part as well as your full construct when relevant sections are hovered or viewed.

When placing, hovering, or interacting with any runes visual indicators will also show for synergy between parts of the construct.
