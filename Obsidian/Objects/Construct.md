# Construct

## Overview

![[construct.png]]

A *Construct* consists of multiple [[Orb|orbs]] empowered through the use of [[Rune|runes]], and a [[Core|core]] attached to the *primary* orb.

The orbs can be held in various shapes and formation through the use of *shape* runes.

If the core is removed, then the construct falls apart.
